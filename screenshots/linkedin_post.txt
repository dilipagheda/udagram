Completed night time Project # Refactoring monolith application into microservices. ðŸ”¥ ðŸ’¥



- Broke down single node.js app into microservices that allows user to upload image to S3 bucket via signed URL and stores meta data into AWS RDS (Postgres)

- Dockerize Angular front end app and backend API microservices

- Set up reverse proxy over backend API

- Set up Kubernetes Cluster using Amazon's EKS. 

- Set up Load balancer service

- Built a CI/CD pipeline using Travis CI which builds and deploys to EKS each time a feature branch is merged with master
